# Nikke-DB-Vue

New front-end code for the Nikke-db website. Stars are welcomed.

Files are hosted in the repo [https://github.com/Nikke-db/Nikke-db.github.io](https://github.com/Nikke-db/Nikke-db.github.io) and uploaded to a cloudflare page website for access.

```git clone, npm install, npm run dev```  
If you know, you know.  

## Want to help?
Sure ! Fork the repository and fix a bug you've found, a bug someone else found, or make your own feature! If possible use Naive UI components that fits the theme of the website. Once the feature is done, open a Pull Request and after trying out the fix or feature I'll add it to the website.  
Make sure mobile display is good enough ( not asking for perfection ), grab width and conditions from other components to have the same workflow. To test it out run ```npm run serve``` and open a network url on your mobile device ( connected on the same wifi ! ) to instantly test out your modification on mobile.

## Pull Requests requirements
Before asking any pull request, run ```npm run format``` and ```npm run lint```, fix all the warning and errors from eslint.
If your feature require to use files, especially spine assets, "si_" icons, "mi_" banners, or anything else, host them on [https://github.com/Nikke-db/Nikke-db.github.io](https://github.com/Nikke-db/Nikke-db.github.io) and make a Pull Request there as well.
